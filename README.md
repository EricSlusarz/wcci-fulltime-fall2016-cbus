# Curriculum Overview
Welcome to coding bootcamp! You will learn an immense amount of material over the course of the next 12 weeks, enough to call yourself a junior programmer, developer or software engineer. Where you take this is up to you. Please note, 90% attendance is required for successful course completion.

The readings and chapter exercises are not suggestions, it is imperative that you keep up with chapter readings and exercises. Yes, this will be challenging, but remember that putting a lot of effort in now is a huge investment in your future.

# Grading Policy

Class is from 9:30am-3:30pm Monday-Friday, with the exception of holidays on which we will not be having class.

You are required to attend a minimum of 90% of class time to be eligible for graduation. Please inform your instructor and TA if extenuating circumstances arise.

In order to pass the course, you must receive a grade of 70% or higher averaged over all the assignments. You must also complete every assignment - any assignments considered **incomplete** must be resubmitted before the end of the course. Finally, you must receive a grade of 70% or higher on the final project.

## Homework Assignments

Homework assignments are self-graded, with students marking each assignment in one of four categories. These categories map to a certain number of points out of 5 possible points for each homework assignment.

You must submit your assignments when they are due, whether or not they are complete or you feel 100% confident in your work. Homework assignments will act primarily as indicators of how you are currently feeling in the moment.

## Projects

Projects are graded by WCCI staff. Projects are typically worth 100 points. 90 points of each project will be determined by the tasks that are completed, with attempts resulting in partial credit for a given task. The final 10 points of each project are determined by overall code quality, including code readability, proper variable names, and comments when necessary.

Projects must be turned in by the date and time specified on the project information page, or else they will receive a late penalty of 10% for each day that the project is late, up to 5 days. After 5 days, the project should still be submitted in order to get credit for project completion per course requirements.

## Final Projects

Final projects will be worth 100 points per week worked on the project, with each week graded independently. These grades will be determined based upon the milestones set for each project and how well those milestones were met.

## Plagiarism Policy
All submitted code must be original code written by the student or the student and project team, unless using an authorized framework or tool (i.e. Twitter Bootstrap). Any plagiarism offense will result in a score of 0 on the assignment. Any plagiarism offense following a first offense could result in expulsion from We Can Code IT Coding Bootcamp.

## Assignment Submission Policy
All assignments must be submitted before the stated deadline through the associated submission form. Assignments that are not submitted through the associated submission form before the stated deadline will receive a 10% deduction. For each day an assignment is late, the assignment will receive a 10% deduction. Any assignment that is more than 4 calendar days late will not be accepted.

## Late Submissions
Assignments are expected to be turned in on time. If an assignment is not turned in by the date / time required, 10% will be subtracted for each day it is late. Unless otherwise noted, you have until midnight of the due date to turn in your assignment. If an assignment is due on 1/1 (by midnight), and you turn it in at 12:05 am on 1/2 , that assignment is considered 1 day late, and will automatically incur a 10% grade penalty. Assignments turned in within 5 days past the due date may not be accepted, and are subject to a score of 0. You must complete all projects in order to pass the course.
